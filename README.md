## Name

minitalk - communication between a client and server with UNIX signals.

## **Synopsis**

**server** - prints server's PID in stdout.
**client** [*server's_pid*] [*string*].

## Description

minitalk creates two programs - a **client** and a **server** - and establishes a communication between then. This data exchange is made using UNIX signals. The server must be started first, and it prints in stdout (standard output) his PID (process ID). The client has to be started with two arguments: [*serverâ€™s PID*] and a [*string*] with the message that will be send by the client. It can be a single word or multiple words between double quotes. After that, server should print the received message in stdout.
